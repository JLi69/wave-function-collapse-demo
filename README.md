# Wave Function Collapse 

This is my attempt at recreating the 
[wave function collapse algorithm](https://github.com/mxgmn/WaveFunctionCollapse)
in Rust but currently the code doesn't work very well for some cases and is 
likely still rather buggy and broken
(I'm not even certain if I implemented the algorithm correctly...)

The code is also not the best quality so forgive me for that.
